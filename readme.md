PHP SHA-3 (Keccak) Extension
============================
This is a PHP extension which is a wrapper for the official implementation of the Keccak hash function, as submitted to the NIST hash function contest and selected to become the official SHA-3 algorithm. SHA-3 is intended to replace older general use hash functions such as SHA-2 and MD5. The algorithm was designed by Guido Bertoni, Joan Daemen, MichaÃ«l Peeters and Gilles Van Assche.

Installation
=============
1. git clone https://github.com/beyonderyue/php-sha3
1. cd php-sha3
1. phpize
1. ./configure --enable-sha3
1. make
1. make install
1. Add the following line to your php.ini file

`extension=sha3.so`

You may need to restart your httpd to load the extension

Usage
=====
`string sha3 ( string $str [, int $outputSize = 512, bool $rawOutput = false ] )`

* $str: The string to hash
* $outputSize: The bit length of the output hash (accepted values: 224, 256, 384, 512)
* $rawOutput: If set to true, then the hash is returned in raw binary format

* Return value: A hex string containing the sha3 hash of the input string

Examples
--------
`echo sha3('');`
